# Two-Phase Spotify to YouTube Converter System

This is an advanced system for converting large Spotify playlists to YouTube while efficiently managing API quota limits. The two-phase approach allows you to convert playlists of any size, even those with hundreds or thousands of tracks.

## 🎯 Why Use the Phase System?

### **Problems with Single-Phase Approach**
- ❌ **Quota Limits**: YouTube API has a daily limit of 10,000 units
- ❌ **Large Playlists**: Can't handle playlists with 100+ tracks in one day
- ❌ **No Recovery**: If interrupted, you lose all progress
- ❌ **Risky**: Might hit quota limits mid-process and fail

### **Benefits of Two-Phase System**
- ✅ **Unlimited Size**: Convert playlists with any number of tracks
- ✅ **Resumable**: Continue where you left off if interrupted
- ✅ **Safe**: Search and playlist creation are separated
- ✅ **Efficient**: Only pay quota costs for what you need
- ✅ **Flexible**: Process over multiple days or use multiple API projects

## 📋 How the Two-Phase System Works

### **Phase 1: Search & Save** (`search-tracks`)
- 🔍 Searches YouTube for matches to each Spotify track
- 💾 Saves results to JSON file progressively (every 5 tracks)
- 🔄 Can be run multiple times to resume/continue
- 💰 Uses ~100 quota units per track searched
- 📊 Provides detailed progress tracking

### **Phase 2: Create Playlist** (`create-playlist`)
- 📝 Reads the JSON file from Phase 1
- 🎬 Creates YouTube playlist and adds all found videos
- 💰 Uses ~50 quota units per video added
- ⚡ Only runs once after all searches are complete
- 📈 Generates final success/failure statistics

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Environment**

Make sure you have completed the setup from the main README.md:
- ✅ Node.js installed
- ✅ Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- ✅ All API credentials configured in `.env` file
- ✅ Spotify and YouTube API connections tested

### **Step 2: Understanding OAuth Authorization Codes**

#### **What is an Authorization Code?**

An authorization code is a temporary code that allows the tool to create YouTube playlists on your behalf. It's required because creating playlists requires your personal YouTube account permissions.

#### **When Do You Need an Authorization Code?**

In the two-phase system, you need authorization codes for:

- ✅ **Phase 2: `create-playlist`** - Creates the YouTube playlist
- ✅ **Retry: `retry-failed`** - Retries adding failed tracks
- ❌ **Phase 1: `search-tracks`** - Not needed (only searches videos)

#### **How to Get an Authorization Code**

##### **Method 1: Automatic OAuth Flow (Recommended)**

When you run Phase 2, it will automatically start the OAuth flow:

```bash
npm run create-playlist 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf
```

**What happens:**
1. Script opens your browser automatically
2. You sign in to your Google account
3. You grant permission to manage YouTube playlists
4. You get redirected to a success page with the authorization code
5. Copy the code from the URL or page
6. Restart the script with the code:

```bash
npm run create-playlist 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf 4/0AVMBsJh...
```

##### **Method 2: Manual OAuth Flow**

If the automatic flow doesn't work, you can get the code manually:

1. **Open this URL in your browser:**
   ```
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl&response_type=code&access_type=offline&prompt=consent
   ```
   (Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Google OAuth Client ID from your `.env` file)

2. **Sign in to your Google account**

3. **Grant permissions** to manage YouTube playlists

4. **Copy the authorization code** from the success page URL

5. **Use the code** with Phase 2:
   ```bash
   npm run create-playlist 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf YOUR_AUTH_CODE
   ```

#### **Authorization Code Format**

Authorization codes look like this:
```
4/0AVMBsJh...
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Starts with `4/0`
- Contains letters, numbers, and sometimes special characters
- Usually 50-100 characters long
- **Expires quickly** (usually within 10 minutes)
- **One-time use** - can only be used once

#### **When Authorization Codes Expire**

Authorization codes expire:
- ⏰ **After 10 minutes** (Google's default)
- ⏰ **After being used once** (even if successful)
- ⏰ **If you get a new one** (invalidates the old one)

**If your code expires:**
1. Get a new authorization code using the same process
2. Use the new code with your script
3. No need to restart from the beginning

#### **OAuth Token Storage**

After using an authorization code successfully:
- ✅ The tool stores a **refresh token** automatically
- ✅ Future runs won't need new authorization codes
- ✅ The refresh token lasts much longer (usually months)
- ✅ Only need new authorization codes if refresh token expires

### **Step 3: Get Your Spotify Playlist ID**

You need the playlist ID to start. Here are three ways to get it:

#### **Method 1: From Spotify Web Player**
1. Open your playlist in Spotify web player
2. Click **"Share"** → **"Copy link to playlist"**
3. The URL looks like: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf`
4. The playlist ID is: `4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf`

#### **Method 2: From Spotify Desktop App**
1. Right-click on your playlist
2. Select **"Share"** → **"Copy Spotify URI"**
3. The URI looks like: `spotify:playlist:4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf`
4. The playlist ID is: `4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf`

#### **Method 3: Direct ID**
If you know the 22-character playlist ID, use it directly.

### **Step 4: Phase 1 - Search for YouTube Matches**

#### **First Run (Start Searching)**
```bash
# Search first 50 tracks (default, safe for daily quota)
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf

# Or specify custom batch size
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf 80
```

#### **Subsequent Runs (Continue Searching)**
```bash
# Continue from where you left off
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf

# Or specify a different batch size
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf 100
```

#### **What Happens During Phase 1**
1. **Loads Progress**: Checks for existing search progress
2. **Retrieves Tracks**: Gets all tracks from your Spotify playlist
3. **Shows Status**: Displays current progress and remaining work
4. **Searches YouTube**: Finds matches for each track
5. **Saves Progress**: Updates progress file every 5 tracks
6. **Reports Results**: Shows success rate and quota usage

## 📊 Quota Management Strategies

### **Understanding YouTube API Quota**

| Operation | Quota Cost | Daily Limit |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Search for videos | 100 units per track | 10,000 units |
| Create playlist | 50 units | 10,000 units |
| Add video to playlist | 50 units per video | 10,000 units |

### **Batch Size Recommendations**

#### **Conservative Strategy (Recommended for Beginners)**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 50    # 5,000 units per day
```
- ✅ **Safe**: Uses 50% of daily quota
- ✅ **Reliable**: Leaves room for other API usage
- ✅ **Flexible**: Can adjust based on needs

#### **Aggressive Strategy (For Fast Processing)**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 100   # 10,000 units per day
```
- ⚡ **Fast**: Uses full daily quota
- ⚠️ **Risky**: No room for other API usage
- 🔄 **Flexible**: Can still process over multiple days

#### **Ultra Safe Strategy (For Critical Systems)**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 25    # 2,500 units per day
```
- 🛡️ **Very Safe**: Uses only 25% of daily quota
- 📊 **Slow**: Takes longer to complete
- 🔧 **Reliable**: Maximum safety margin

### **Multi-Day Processing Example**

For a 200-track playlist:

#### **Day 1: Search First Batch**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 50
# Result: 50 tracks searched, 5,000 units used
```

#### **Day 2: Search Second Batch**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 50
# Result: 100 tracks searched, 10,000 units used
```

#### **Day 3: Search Third Batch**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 50
# Result: 150 tracks searched, 15,000 units used
```

#### **Day 4: Search Final Batch**
```bash
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 50
# Result: 200 tracks searched, 20,000 units used
```

#### **Day 5: Create Playlist**
```bash
npm run create-playlist playlist_id
# Result: Playlist created with ~180 videos, 9,050 units used
```

**Total Time**: 5 days
**Total Quota**: 29,050 units (spread across multiple days)

### **Multiple Google Cloud Projects Strategy**

For unlimited daily processing, create multiple Google Cloud projects:

#### **Setup Multiple Projects**
1. Create 2-3 Google Cloud projects
2. Enable YouTube Data API v3 in each
3. Create API keys for each project
4. Store different API keys in separate `.env` files

#### **Usage Example**
```bash
# Morning: Project 1 (10,000 units)
cp .env.project1 .env
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 100

# Afternoon: Project 2 (10,000 units)
cp .env.project2 .env
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 100

# Evening: Project 3 (10,000 units)
cp .env.project3 .env
npm run search-tracks playlist_id 100

# Result: 300 tracks searched in one day!
```

## 📁 File Management

### **Understanding the Data Files**

The system creates several files in the `data/` directory:

#### **`{playlist_id}-search-progress.json`**
- **Purpose**: Stores all search results from Phase 1
- **Content**: Track information, YouTube matches, confidence scores, progress statistics
- **Usage**: Read by Phase 2 to create playlist
- **Backup**: Safe to backup, copy, or share

#### **`{playlist_id}-playlist-result.json`**
- **Purpose**: Stores final conversion results
- **Content**: Playlist creation details, success/failure information, final statistics
- **Usage**: Read by retry script to attempt failed tracks
- **Backup**: Safe to backup for record keeping

### **File Structure Example**
```
data/
├── 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf-search-progress.json    # Phase 1 results
└── 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf-playlist-result.json    # Final results
```

### **Progress File Contents**

## 🔄 Resuming from Interruption

### **What Happens When Interrupted**

If Phase 1 is interrupted (power loss, network issues, etc.):

1. **Progress is Preserved**: Last saved position is maintained
2. **No Data Loss**: All completed searches are saved
3. **Easy Resume**: Simply run the same command again

### **Resuming Phase 1**

```bash
# After interruption, just run the same command
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf

# The script will show:
📂 Loading existing progress from: data/4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf-search-progress.json
📈 Current Progress:
   Tracks processed: 47/123
   Tracks found: 44
   Tracks not found: 3
   Quota used so far: 4,700 units

💰 This session will process 50 tracks (~5,000 quota units)
📊 Remaining tracks after this session: 26

# It will continue from track 48 automatically
```

### **API Key Rotation & Continuation**

Progress tracking works across different API keys:

```bash
# Day 1: API Key 1 - processes tracks 1-50
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...project1
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf 50

# Day 2: API Key 2 - continues from track 51!
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...project2  
npm run search-tracks 4OA5qo67rHBa7KY34NuHPf 50
# ✅ Automatically continues from track 51
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"Search progress file not found"**
- **Cause**: You need to run Phase 1 first
- **Solution**: Run `npm run search-tracks <playlist_id>` before Phase 2
- **Check**: Make sure playlist ID matches exactly

#### **"Quota exceeded" during Phase 1**
- **Cause**: Daily quota limit reached
- **Solution**: Wait until quota resets (midnight PT) or use different Google Cloud project
- **Alternative**: Reduce batch size and try again
- **Note**: Script will resume from last saved position

#### **"No tracks with YouTube matches found"**
- **Cause**: All searches failed to find matches
- **Solution**: Check your YouTube API key and try running Phase 1 again
- **Alternative**: Verify your internet connection and API key permissions

#### **"OAuth flow initiated" during Phase 2**
- **Cause**: No valid OAuth token for playlist creation
- **Solution**: Complete the OAuth flow in your browser and restart with authorization code
- **Process**: Follow the browser prompts to grant YouTube permissions

#### **"Playlist creation failed"**
- **Cause**: OAuth token expired or insufficient permissions
- **Solution**: Get a fresh authorization code and retry
- **Alternative**: Check that your OAuth credentials are correct

#### **"Some videos failed to add"**
- **Cause**: Videos may have restrictions (private, deleted, embedding disabled)
- **Solution**: Use `npm run retry-failed` to attempt failed tracks again
- **Note**: Some failures may be permanent due to video restrictions

#### **"Authorization code expired"**
- **Cause**: Authorization codes expire after 10 minutes or one use
- **Solution**: Get a new authorization code using the OAuth flow
- **Note**: No need to restart from the beginning

#### **"Invalid authorization code"**
- **Cause**: Code was copied incorrectly or has expired
- **Solution**: Make sure you copied the entire code correctly
- **Check**: Code should start with `4/0` and be 50-100 characters long
